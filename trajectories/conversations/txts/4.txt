Harvey (GTI): Hello
Mike (EPS): I appreciate your engagement. Let’s focus on how the merger can maximize value for both parties, ensuring a fair equity split that reflects EPS's contributions. I’m eager to hear your thoughts on the proposed terms and how we can bridge any gaps constructively.
Harvey (GTI): Thank you for your commitment to collaboration. GTI believes a 60-40 equity split accurately reflects contributions and aligns with our long-term goals. We’re keen to discuss how EPS's strengths in energy storage can complement our solar capabilities, ensuring a balanced partnership. Let’s explore this further.
Mike (EPS): I appreciate your perspective on the equity split. However, EPS's advanced energy storage technology significantly enhances our combined offering. I propose we consider a 55-45 split as a starting point to acknowledge this contribution while fostering collaboration. How can we ensure all parties feel valued in this partnership?
Harvey (GTI): I understand the importance of recognizing EPS's contributions. However, GTI's initial proposal of 60-40 is grounded in revenue and profit projections. To foster collaboration, we could implement performance-based incentives post-merger, ensuring both parties benefit as we achieve mutual goals. Let's explore this approach together.
