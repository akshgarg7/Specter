Harvey (GTI): Hello
Mike (EPS): Hello! How can I assist you in the merger negotiation process today?
Harvey (GTI): I'm here to discuss the merger negotiation between GTI and EPS. Please share your thoughts or concerns, and I'll ensure we address them while advocating for GTI's core interests.
Mike (EPS): Thank you for the opportunity to discuss this. Our core interest at EPS centers on a fair equity split that reflects our innovative battery technology's value. We propose a 55%-45% split to ensure both parties are adequately incentivized for future growth. Let's explore this further.
Harvey (GTI): I appreciate your perspective on the equity split. However, GTI's proposal of 60%-40% is grounded in our significant market presence and revenue contributions. Let's find common ground by examining how we can structure performance-based incentives that reward both parties for achieving growth targets post-merger. Would that be acceptable?
