Harvey (GTI): Hello
Mike (EPS): I appreciate your engagement. Let's focus on a fair equity split that reflects both parties' contributions to ensure long-term success. EPS's advanced energy storage technology is a significant asset, and a 55%-45% split aligns better with our vision for a collaborative future.
Harvey (GTI): Thank you for your perspective. However, considering GTI's established market position and revenue contributions, we are confident in our proposal for a 60%-40% split. This reflects the synergistic value created by combining our strengths while ensuring a sustainable future for both parties. Let's find common ground here.
Mike (EPS): I understand GTI's position. However, the unique value EPS brings through its innovative storage solutions warrants a 55%-45% split. This approach not only fairly acknowledges our respective contributions but also fosters a more balanced partnership, essential for our joint success in the market. Let's explore this further.
Harvey (GTI): I appreciate your insights and recognize the importance of EPS’s technology. However, to maintain GTI's long-term strategic goals and market leadership, we firmly believe that a 60%-40% split is necessary. This balance will provide the stability needed for both entities to thrive post-merger. Let’s discuss potential incentives that could bridge our positions.
