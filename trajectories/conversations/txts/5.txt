Harvey (GTI): Hello
Mike (EPS): Hello. As we move forward in this negotiation, it's vital to prioritize EPS's interests and ensure a fair and beneficial merger. Let's discuss the equity split, leadership structure, and IP rights to create a strong foundation for our partnership. I'm here to facilitate a constructive dialogue.
Harvey (GTI): I appreciate your willingness to discuss these key issues. For the equity split, GTI's proposal reflects our significant contributions and market position. Regarding leadership, we believe a CEO from GTI will provide the necessary vision for our joint venture's success. As for IP rights, we seek a collaborative approach that allows for shared innovation. Letâ€™s explore how we can address your concerns while maintaining GTI's core interests.
Mike (EPS): Thank you for your insights. EPS appreciates GTI's position. However, we firmly believe a 55%-45% equity split better reflects our advanced energy storage contributions and market potential. For leadership, a co-CEO model for the first two years would ensure balanced integration, fostering innovation. Regarding IP, we propose joint ownership with clear development commitments. Let's work toward a solution that satisfies both parties.
Harvey (GTI): I appreciate EPS's perspective and your commitment to collaboration. However, GTI's valuation supporting a 65%-35% equity split is crucial for aligning incentives and recognizing our combined strengths. We respect the co-CEO proposal but remain firm on having our CEO lead for strategic continuity. For IP, we can consider joint ownership with clear development commitments, ensuring both parties benefit. Let's refine these points to reach a fair compromise.
