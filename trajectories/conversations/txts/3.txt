Harvey (GTI): Hello
Mike (EPS): Hello. Thank you for engaging in this negotiation. EPS is committed to a successful merger that aligns with our long-term goals. Let’s explore solutions that address your priorities while ensuring EPS’s interests are protected. What specific concerns do you have that we can collaboratively address?
Harvey (GTI): Thank you for your openness. GTI values a strategic merger that enhances our market position. Our primary concerns include valuation, integration processes, and long-term growth potential. We seek solutions that ensure fair valuation and a clear integration plan. Let’s discuss how we can align our interests effectively.
Mike (EPS): I appreciate your priorities, GTI. EPS is equally invested in a strategic merger. To address valuation, we propose an independent third-party assessment to ensure fairness. For integration, we can outline a detailed plan with joint teams to facilitate a smooth transition. How does this approach align with your vision?
Harvey (GTI): We appreciate the proposal for an independent assessment; it reflects transparency, which is vital for our collaboration. The detailed integration plan with joint teams aligns well with GTI’s goal of a seamless transition. Let’s discuss how we can structure the assessment and define team roles to maximize effectiveness.
