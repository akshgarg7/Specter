Harvey (GTI): Hello
Mike (EPS): Hello, thank you for your engagement. Let's focus on aligning our objectives for a successful merger. EPS values its advanced technology and seeks a fair equity split that reflects its contributions. We propose a 60%-40% split, ensuring both parties benefit while fostering innovation and market growth. Let's discuss.
Harvey (GTI): Thank you for your proposal. While we acknowledge EPS's contributions, our analysis supports a 65%-35% equity split, reflecting GTI's stronger market presence and revenue generation. This structure will ensure sustained innovation and robust growth, aligning interests for both parties. Let's explore how we can bridge this gap.
Mike (EPS): I appreciate your perspective and recognize GTI's market presence. However, EPS's advanced battery technology is pivotal for our joint innovation strategy. A 60%-40% split not only reflects our contributions but also incentivizes collaboration. Let’s discuss how this equitable foundation can drive our shared vision and attract strategic investment.
Harvey (GTI): I appreciate your acknowledgment of GTI's strengths. To foster collaboration, we propose a compromise of a 62.5%-37.5% split.

Let’s explore this further.
