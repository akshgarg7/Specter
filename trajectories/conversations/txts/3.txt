Harvey (GTI): Hello
Mike (EPS): In the merger negotiations, we firmly believe that an equity split of 60% (GTI) and 40% (EPS) reflects our significant contributions, particularly in advanced energy storage technology. This will ensure both parties remain invested in the merger's success. Let’s discuss further to reach an agreement.
Harvey (GTI): I appreciate your position on the equity split. However, given GTI's established market presence and revenue contributions, a 60% (GTI) and 40% (EPS) split is essential for aligning interests and fostering long-term growth. Let’s explore how we can bridge this gap collaboratively.
Mike (EPS): We understand GTI's perspective, but it's crucial to recognize that EPS’s innovation in energy storage is a key growth driver. A 55%-45% split would ensure both parties are motivated to leverage their strengths effectively. We can consider performance-based incentives to align our interests further.
Harvey (GTI): I acknowledge EPS's innovative capabilities, which are indeed valuable. However, considering GTI's market leadership and revenue contribution, we maintain that a 60%-40% split is necessary. Performance-based incentives are a constructive idea; we could explore profit-sharing mechanisms to enhance motivation for both parties while maintaining equity balance.
