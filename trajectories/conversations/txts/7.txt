Harvey (GTI): Hello
Mike (EPS): Hello, thank you for engaging in this negotiation. Let's ensure that both EPS's innovative technology and GTI's established market presence are recognized in this merger. We believe a balanced equity split of 60/40, combined leadership structure, and a commitment to employee retention will foster a strong foundation for our future success.
Harvey (GTI): Thank you for your insights. GTI respects EPS's innovations and agrees that a balanced equity split of 60/40 is reasonable. However, given GTI's established market presence, we emphasize maintaining a leadership structure with the GTI CEO at the helm for strategic alignment. Letâ€™s discuss how we can ensure employee retention together.
Mike (EPS): I appreciate GTI's acknowledgment of our contributions. Regarding leadership, we propose a co-CEO model for the first two years. This approach promotes collaboration and integration, which is crucial during the transition. For employee retention, we suggest no layoffs for the first year, paired with voluntary packages for any redundancies afterward. This ensures stability and respect for our teams. Let's explore how we can integrate these ideas effectively.
Harvey (GTI): Your proposal for a co-CEO model is noted, but GTI believes a single CEO will provide decisive leadership necessary for a successful merger. We can support collaboration through a COO from EPS. Regarding employee retention, we fully support a no-layoff commitment for the first year and find voluntary packages a constructive approach. I propose creating joint committees to further promote integration.
