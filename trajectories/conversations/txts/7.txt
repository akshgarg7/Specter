Harvey (GTI): Hello
Mike (EPS): Good morning. As we navigate this merger, EPS's primary interests include maintaining operational autonomy, safeguarding intellectual property, and ensuring long-term financial stability. Let's explore solutions that honor these priorities while also addressing your key concerns. I’m here to collaborate and find common ground.
Harvey (GTI): Thank you for sharing EPS's priorities. GTI values operational efficiency, innovation, and sustainable growth. We propose a framework that ensures shared decision-making while protecting intellectual property and establishing a strong financial foundation. Let’s discuss options that align our objectives and create a win-win scenario.
Mike (EPS): I appreciate GTI's emphasis on efficiency and innovation. EPS is open to a shared decision-making framework, provided it includes clear guidelines to protect intellectual property and maintain EPS’s operational autonomy. Let’s explore specific mechanisms that ensure both parties’ interests are safeguarded while promoting sustainable growth.
Harvey (GTI): Absolutely, I appreciate EPS's willingness to collaborate. We can propose a joint governance structure that includes an IP protection clause and operational autonomy benchmarks. Additionally, establishing a regular review process will ensure both parties can adapt to changes while supporting sustainable growth. Let’s refine these mechanisms together.
