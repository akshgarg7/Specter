Harvey (GTI): Hello
Mike (EPS): Thank you for your engagement. Let's focus on achieving a fair equity split that acknowledges EPS's valuable IP contributions while respecting GTI's market presence. We propose a 60% (GTI) and 40% (EPS) split as a reasonable compromise. This structure supports long-term growth objectives for both parties.
Harvey (GTI): I appreciate your willingness to engage in a constructive discussion. The 60%-40% equity split ensures GTI's leadership reflects our significant market presence while fairly recognizing EPS's IP contributions. This structure will drive our joint growth and innovation. Let's work toward finalizing this agreement.
