Harvey (GTI): Hello
Mike (EPS): Thank you for initiating this discussion. Let's focus on finding a mutually beneficial path forward that aligns with EPS's long-term goals while respecting your priorities. I’m eager to hear your thoughts on the proposed terms, particularly concerning the equity split and leadership structure.
Harvey (GTI): Thank you for your openness. Regarding the equity split, GTI’s proposal of 60% aligns with our significant contributions and market position. On leadership, while we respect EPS's desire for shared leadership, we believe a strong CEO from GTI will ensure focused integration and effective decision-making. How does EPS envision addressing these areas?
Mike (EPS): We appreciate GTI’s position on the equity split. However, given EPS's advanced energy storage technology and its strategic value, a 60% (GTI) to 40% (EPS) split is more equitable. For leadership, we propose a co-CEO arrangement for the first two years to leverage both strengths effectively during integration. This approach can enhance collaboration and ensure smooth transitions. How does that align with GTI’s vision?
Harvey (GTI): While we recognize the value of EPS's technology, GTI's market presence and resources warrant a 60% equity stake. Regarding leadership, our preference for a sole CEO is based on the need for clear direction. However, we’re open to discussing a COO role from EPS to ensure collaborative integration. Would that be acceptable?
