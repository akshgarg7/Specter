Thank you for bringing this up. The equity split and leadership structure are pivotal components of the merger, and it's important that we address these thoughtfully to ensure a successful collaboration between GTI and EPS.

### **Equity Split**

GTI initially proposed a 65% to 35% equity split based on our revenue and profit contributions. However, recognizing the importance of finding common ground, we have revised our stance and suggest a more balanced approach of 60% for GTI and 40% for EPS. This proposal reflects a fair acknowledgment of EPS's valuable battery technology while ensuring that GTI retains a majority share, which is essential for maintaining our strategic direction and long-term goals.

We believe this equitable distribution will foster a sense of partnership and shared responsibility, aligning both companies toward achieving our ambitious growth targets in the integrated renewable energy market. 

### **Leadership Structure**

Regarding the leadership structure, GTI strongly believes that having our CEO lead the merged entity is crucial. Given GTI's established market presence and experience, this leadership position would provide the necessary vision and strategic oversight to navigate the complexities of the merger and drive the combined company forward.

However, I'm open to discussing your proposal for a co-CEO arrangement for the first two years. Perhaps we could consider appointing our CEO as the CEO and your COO as the President or an equally significant executive role during this transitional period. This would ensure representation from both sides while allowing for a clear leadership hierarchy, which can be particularly beneficial in the early stages of integration.

### **Next Steps**

I encourage you to share your thoughts on this proposal. It’s essential that we listen actively to your priorities, as I believe finding a mutually beneficial solution will set a positive tone for our ongoing discussions. Together, we can ensure that the merger not only aligns with our respective interests but also positions us competitively in the marketplace.
Thank you for bringing up these crucial points—equity split and leadership structure are foundational to a successful merger. 

### **Equity Split**

GTI initially proposed a 65% equity stake for GTI and 35% for EPS, based on our substantial market share, revenue contributions, and strong financial performance. However, we understand that EPS has expressed a desire for a more balanced split, suggesting a 55% (GTI) and 45% (EPS) distribution. 

To reach a mutually beneficial agreement, we propose a compromise of a **60% (GTI) and 40% (EPS)** equity split. This acknowledges the value that both parties bring to the table—GTI’s established market presence and EPS's innovative battery technology—while ensuring GTI retains a controlling interest that reflects our contributions to the merged entity’s future direction and strategy.

### **Leadership Structure**

Leadership is another area where we see potential for alignment. GTI proposes having its CEO lead the merged organization, given our proven track record and experience in the solar market. This is essential for setting a clear strategic vision and maintaining investor confidence.

However, we also recognize EPS’s proposal for a co-CEO arrangement during the initial integration phase. This could help facilitate smoother transitions and address any apprehensions from EPS stakeholders. 

To find a middle ground, we suggest the following leadership structure:
- **CEO from GTI**: This ensures a strong leadership presence aligned with GTI’s strategic objectives.
- **COO from EPS**: This role would focus on integrating EPS’s advanced technology and operational processes into the new organization, leveraging their expertise in battery storage systems.
- **CTO**: A newly created position to be filled jointly, reflecting the innovative strengths of both companies and fostering collaboration in R&D.

This structure balances both companies' interests and expertise while fostering a collaborative leadership environment. 

I look forward to your thoughts on these proposals and to working together to finalize terms that respect the priorities of both parties.
