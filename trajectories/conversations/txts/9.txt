Harvey (GTI): Hello
Mike (EPS): I appreciate your engagement. To advance our discussions, let’s prioritize a fair equity split that reflects EPS's R&D contributions while ensuring strong leadership integration. I propose we explore options that align both parties’ interests, particularly in IP protection and cultural integration. Your thoughts?
Harvey (GTI): Thank you for your constructive approach. GTI values EPS's contributions and is open to discussions on equity. However, our proposed split reflects GTI's revenue and market position. Leadership should prioritize GTI's experience. Regarding IP, we seek full access, ensuring protection. Cultural integration is vital, and we support joint efforts.
Mike (EPS): I respect GTI's position and appreciate your openness. However, a 60/40 equity split acknowledges EPS’s unique value in energy storage, crucial for future growth. For leadership, a co-CEO arrangement initially can leverage both strengths. Regarding IP, we can agree on collaborative access while ensuring EPS’s patents are safeguarded. Let’s refine these points together.
Harvey (GTI): We acknowledge EPS’s value, yet GTI firmly believes a 65/35 split aligns with our contributions and future potential. A co-CEO arrangement may dilute leadership; we prefer a clear direction. Collaborative access to IP is acceptable, provided GTI retains rights to utilize it fully. Let's work on these points constructively.
