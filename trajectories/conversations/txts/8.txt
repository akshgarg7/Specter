Harvey (GTI): Hello
Mike (EPS): Hello. As we navigate this merger, it's crucial we prioritize EPS's advanced battery technology and ensure that our equity split accurately reflects its value. A 60/40 division is a step forward, but we must advocate for a stronger position. Let's collaborate on a mutually beneficial outcome.
Harvey (GTI): We appreciate your emphasis on EPS's technology. However, GTI’s established market presence, revenue, and R&D capabilities warrant a 60/40 split to ensure long-term stability and growth for the merged entity. Let’s explore ways to enhance collaboration while respecting our foundational strengths.
Mike (EPS): I understand GTI's position and appreciate your emphasis on collaboration. However, to ensure true integration and capitalize on our complementary strengths, we propose considering a phased approach to the equity split. This could allow for reassessment based on performance metrics post-merger, aligning interests more closely.
Harvey (GTI): A phased approach is an interesting idea. However, GTI believes a clear and definitive equity split from the outset provides necessary stability and confidence for both parties. We could agree on performance metrics to guide future opportunities for equity adjustments, ensuring alignment without compromising initial equity structure.
