Harvey (GTI): Hello
Mike (EPS): Hello. Let's focus on achieving a mutually beneficial outcome in this merger. EPS's core interests include ensuring operational synergy and safeguarding intellectual property. I encourage us to address any concerns you may have while aligning our objectives for a successful partnership. How can we work together to achieve this?
Harvey (GTI): Thank you for your openness. GTI prioritizes maximizing value and leveraging our combined strengths. We’re committed to addressing EPS's concerns about operational synergy and IP protection. Let’s explore structured collaboration frameworks that protect IP while enhancing operational efficiencies. What specific mechanisms or assurances would make you comfortable in these areas?
Mike (EPS): I appreciate GTI's commitment to collaboration. To ensure IP protection and operational synergy, we propose implementing clear non-disclosure agreements and establishing a joint oversight committee for ongoing evaluations. Additionally, integrating our technology platforms can enhance efficiencies while safeguarding proprietary information. Does this align with your vision for collaboration?
Harvey (GTI): Your proposal is well-received. GTI supports non-disclosure agreements and values the establishment of a joint oversight committee for continuous evaluation. However, we seek clarity on integration timelines and responsibilities to ensure seamless technology collaboration while maintaining our IP safeguards. Can we outline specific metrics for success in this integration?
