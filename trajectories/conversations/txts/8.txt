Harvey (GTI): Hello
Mike (EPS): Hello. Let's discuss how we can move forward in the negotiation effectively. EPS is committed to achieving a fair equity split, ensuring leadership collaboration, and protecting our intellectual property rights. Your input on these priorities is valuable for creating a mutually beneficial merger.
Harvey (GTI): Absolutely, I appreciate your focus on collaboration. For the equity split, we believe a 60/40 arrangement aligns with contributions and market positions. Regarding leadership, we support a CEO from GTI while incorporating an EPS COO for balance. As for IP, we can assure full access while protecting EPS's innovations. Let's continue this constructive dialogue.
Mike (EPS): Thank you for your response. The 60/40 equity split is a step closer, but EPS justifies a 55/45 split based on our strong R&D contributions. Regarding leadership, a co-CEO model for the initial two years would foster better integration. For IP, mutual access is crucial, but protections for EPS's innovations must remain robust.
Harvey (GTI): I appreciate EPS's strong R&D contributions, but a 60/40 split reflects GTI's valuation and market strength. We can explore a performance-based adjustment after two years. For leadership, we can consider a clear delineation of roles rather than co-CEO, ensuring effective decision-making. Regarding IP, we commit to robust protections while allowing access for innovation growth. Let's find common ground.
