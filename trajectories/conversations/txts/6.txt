Harvey (GTI): Hello
Mike (EPS): Thank you for the introduction. As we proceed with these negotiations, let's focus on achieving a fair equity split and ensure the leadership structure reflects both parties' contributions and values. I'm here to advocate strongly for EPS's interests while also fostering collaboration for a successful merger.
Harvey (GTI): I appreciate your commitment to collaboration. For a fair equity split, GTI's proposal of 60% aligns with our significant market share and established brand. We believe this split will facilitate strong leadership under GTI's CEO while also recognizing EPS's contributions through key operational roles. Let's ensure a balanced approach.
Mike (EPS): I appreciate your perspective on the equity split. However, given EPS's advanced energy storage technology and future growth potential, a 55%-45% split is more equitable. This adjustment recognizes EPS's critical role in innovation and aligns with our long-term goals. Letâ€™s work together to find a balanced solution.
Harvey (GTI): I understand the value EPS brings with its innovative technology. However, GTI's 60%-40% proposal is grounded in our current market leadership and revenue contributions. We can consider performance-based incentives tied to shared growth targets to further recognize EPS's contributions while maintaining the integrity of our equity structure.
