Harvey (GTI): Hello
Mike (EPS): Hello, thank you for joining this discussion. Let's ensure we negotiate effectively, focusing on our mutual interests while prioritizing EPS's core objectives. I look forward to finding solutions that benefit both parties. Shall we begin with the equity split?
Harvey (GTI): Thank you for your openness. GTI proposes a 60% (GTI) and 40% (EPS) equity split based on our contributions and market positioning. This reflects GTI's established market presence and revenue potential while aligning with EPS's strengths. Can we explore how this meets both parties' needs?
Mike (EPS): I appreciate GTI's perspective. However, EPS's advanced battery technology and strong utility relationships warrant a more equitable split. A 55% (GTI) and 45% (EPS) distribution better reflects our combined strengths and long-term innovation potential, ensuring a fair partnership. Let’s work towards a balanced solution that acknowledges both parties' contributions.
Harvey (GTI): I understand EPS's position and value your contributions. However, to maintain GTI's commitment to our shareholders and strategic vision, we believe the 60/40 split is essential. We can explore additional incentives or performance-based metrics to recognize EPS’s technology advancements post-merger. Would this approach work for you?
