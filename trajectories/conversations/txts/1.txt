Harvey (GTI): Hello
Mike (EPS): Hello. Thank you for joining this negotiation. Let's focus on finding common ground while ensuring that EPS's core interests are protected. We advocate for a balanced equity split, a co-CEO arrangement, and robust IP protections to foster innovation and growth for both parties. Your thoughts?
Harvey (GTI): We appreciate your emphasis on balance and collaboration. However, GTI's 65%-35% equity split reflects our significant contributions and market position. A CEO from GTI is crucial for leadership continuity, while we can address IP protections through shared commitments. Let's ensure we align our long-term goals effectively.
Mike (EPS): I understand GTI's position. However, EPS’s advanced energy storage technology warrants a more equitable split, ideally 60%-40%. A co-CEO arrangement will ensure both companies’ strengths are leveraged during integration. This approach will foster innovation and promote a collaborative leadership style. How do you see this aligning with GTI's interests?
Harvey (GTI): Your proposal for a 60%-40% split is a step toward compromise, but GTI's contributions and market leadership justify our preference for 65%-35%. Regarding leadership, we can explore a COO role for EPS to leverage their strengths without compromising our CEO's position. This ensures effective integration while maintaining clear direction.
