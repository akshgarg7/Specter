Harvey (GTI): Hello
Mike (EPS): Hello, thank you for meeting today. Let's focus on establishing a mutually beneficial merger. EPS's advanced battery technology adds significant value, justifying our proposed 45% equity stake. We are committed to protecting our intellectual property and ensuring job stability during the merger. Let's work together to achieve our shared goals.
Harvey (GTI): Thank you for your input. While we recognize the value of EPS's technology, a 60/40 equity split is essential for reflecting GTI's market position and contributions. We are open to discussing IP protections and employee retention, aiming for a balanced approach that serves both parties' interests. Let's find common ground.
Mike (EPS): I appreciate your willingness to discuss this. However, EPS's innovative technology is crucial for future growth, warranting a 45% stake. We can explore robust IP protections to ensure both parties benefit. Regarding employee retention, we propose no layoffs in the first year to support integration. Let's keep the dialogue constructive.
Harvey (GTI): I appreciate your perspective on EPS's technology. Acknowledging GTI's established market share and revenue, we stand firm on a 60/40 equity split. We're committed to robust IP protections and can agree on no layoffs in the first year, fostering a collaborative environment for integration. Let's build on this foundation.
