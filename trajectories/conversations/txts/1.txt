Harvey (GTI): Hello
Mike (EPS): Hello. Let’s address EPS’s core interests: ensuring a fair valuation, protecting intellectual property, and maintaining operational autonomy post-merger. I’d like to understand your priorities to explore solutions that align with both parties' long-term goals. Let’s work collaboratively to ensure a successful outcome for everyone involved.
Harvey (GTI): Thank you for outlining EPS's interests. GTI's priorities include achieving a premium valuation, securing our innovative assets, and ensuring a seamless integration process. We believe a well-structured agreement can address both parties' concerns, fostering a strong partnership. Let's explore how we can align these objectives effectively.
Mike (EPS): I appreciate your focus on a premium valuation and seamless integration. To align our objectives, we propose a valuation framework that incorporates EPS’s unique assets, ensuring mutual benefit. Additionally, we can establish a dedicated integration team, allowing both parties to leverage innovative assets while protecting core interests. What are your thoughts on this approach?
Harvey (GTI): Your proposal for a valuation framework is constructive and aligns with GTI's goals. We support establishing a dedicated integration team, but we must ensure it includes representatives from GTI to safeguard our interests and facilitate knowledge transfer. Let's discuss specific roles and responsibilities to optimize this collaboration.
