Harvey (GTI): Hello
Mike (EPS): Hello! How may I assist you today regarding the merger negotiation between EPS and the potential partner companies?
Harvey (GTI): I’d like to discuss the valuation and equity split. GTI proposes a 60/40 split, reflecting our greater contribution. It’s essential we maintain this structure to ensure alignment with our long-term goals. How can we find common ground on this critical issue?
Mike (EPS): I appreciate GTI's perspective on the equity split. However, EPS's advancements in energy storage warrant a more equitable 55/45 split. This would not only recognize our contributions but also foster a collaborative spirit for future innovation. Let’s explore potential performance-based adjustments to align our interests effectively.
Harvey (GTI): I appreciate EPS's viewpoint on the equity split. However, maintaining a 60/40 structure ensures GTI's commitment to driving the merged entity's success. Performance-based adjustments could be a viable solution, but let’s ensure they are realistic and reflect GTI’s significant market presence. How does that sound?
