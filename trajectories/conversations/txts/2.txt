Harvey (GTI): Hello
Mike (EPS): Thank you for engaging in this dialogue. It's crucial for EPS to ensure that the equity split recognizes our advanced energy storage technology's value. Let's explore a 60-40 split while addressing your interests in leadership and branding to create a unified vision. Your thoughts?
Harvey (GTI): I appreciate your perspective on the equity split. However, given GTI's significant contributions and market position, we firmly advocate for a 65-35 split. This reflects our revenue and profit contributions. Regarding leadership, we can consider a CEO from GTI while assuring input from EPS to foster collaboration. Let's work towards a unified vision that respects both our strengths.
Mike (EPS): I understand GTI's position on the equity split, but EPS's innovations warrant a more balanced approach. How about a compromise of 60-40, paired with a commitment to evaluate contributions annually? Regarding leadership, a co-CEO approach for the first two years ensures collaborative integration and effectiveness. Would you consider this?
Harvey (GTI): While I recognize the value of EPS's innovations, a 60-40 split does not align with GTI's contributions and long-term goals. We can explore a 65-35 split with an annual review mechanism to assess each company's contributions. As for leadership, we prefer a clear CEO role from GTI, ensuring decisive direction while maintaining collaboration.
