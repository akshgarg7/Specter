Harvey (GTI): Hello
Mike (EPS): Hello, thank you for engaging in this negotiation. EPS is committed to ensuring a successful merger that reflects our innovative strengths and provides a balanced equity split. We propose a 60% (GTI) and 40% (EPS) equity structure, aligning with our strategic goals while recognizing EPS's advanced technology contributions. Let's discuss further.
Harvey (GTI): Thank you for your proposal. We appreciate EPS’s commitment to a successful merger. However, GTI’s initial assessment supports a 65% (GTI) and 35% (EPS) split, reflecting our market share and profitability. We believe this structure will ensure a stable foundation for future growth. Let's explore this further.
Mike (EPS): I appreciate GTI's perspective. However, EPS’s advanced battery technology and growth potential warrant a revised equity split. A 60%-40% arrangement aligns better with our respective contributions and encourages collaborative innovation. This equitable split will foster a strong partnership, essential for our shared long-term growth. Let’s work towards a solution that benefits both parties.
Harvey (GTI): I understand your position and the importance of equitable contributions. Let's consider a compromise: a 62.5% (GTI) and 37.5% (EPS) equity split. This acknowledges GTI's established market presence while still recognizing EPS's innovative technology. This balanced approach can strengthen our partnership and drive collaborative innovation. What are your thoughts?
