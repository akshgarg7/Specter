We\u2019re keen to discuss how EPS's strengths in energy storage can complement our solar capabilities, ensuring a balanced partnership. Let\u2019s explore this further."

I propose we consider a 55-45 split as a starting point to acknowledge this contribution while fostering collaboration. How can we ensure all parties feel valued in this partnership?"

        "speaker": "Harvey (GTI)",
        "message": "I understand the importance of recognizing EPS's contributions. However, GTI's initial proposal of 60-40 is grounded in revenue and profit projections. To foster collaboration, we could implement performance-based incentives post-merger, ensuring both parties benefit as we achieve mutual goals. Let's explore this approach together."
