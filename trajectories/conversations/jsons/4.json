However, considering GTI's market share and profitability, we propose a 60% (GTI) and 40% (EPS) equity split. This structure positions us for long-term success while acknowledging both parties' strengths. Let's explore this further."

However, to align with our innovative edge in battery technology and the strategic fit of our combined offerings, we believe that a 55% (GTI) and 45% (EPS) split is necessary for equitable collaboration and shared commitment. Let\u2019s discuss how we can bridge this gap."

To bridge the gap, we could consider performance-based milestones post-merger that could adjust equity stakes based on achieved financial targets. This ensures both parties benefit fairly from our combined success while respecting GTI's initial position. What are your thoughts?"
