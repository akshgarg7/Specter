        "message": "Hello! Let's focus on our objectives for the merger negotiation. EPS's advanced energy storage solutions are crucial, and we must ensure a fair equity split reflecting our value. Additionally, protecting our intellectual property is non-negotiable. I'm here to advocate for these interests while seeking common ground. How can we proceed?"

        "speaker": "Harvey (GTI)",
        "message": "I appreciate your focus on a balanced approach. For the equity split, GTI's contribution justifies a 60% share, aligning with our long-term goals. Regarding intellectual property, we can agree on full access to EPS's IP while ensuring their innovations are protected post-merger. Let's discuss how we can solidify these terms."

    {
        "speaker": "Mike (EPS)",
        "message": "I appreciate your willingness to find common ground. While a 60% share is a step, EPS's technological contributions warrant a minimum of 45%. We must also outline clear legal protections for our IP to ensure continued innovation. Let\u2019s explore a balanced equity split and robust IP safeguards that benefit both parties."
    },
    {
        "speaker": "Harvey (GTI)",
        "message": "Thank you for your insights. I propose we settle on a 65% (GTI) and 35% (EPS) equity split, reflecting GTI's market position while acknowledging EPS's contributions. For IP protections, we can draft a robust agreement ensuring EPS's patents remain safeguarded while allowing GTI access for development. How does this align with your perspective?"
