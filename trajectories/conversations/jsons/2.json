However, GTI\u2019s initial assessment supports a 65% (GTI) and 35% (EPS) split, reflecting our market share and profitability.

A 60%-40% arrangement aligns better with our respective contributions and encourages collaborative innovation. This equitable split will foster a strong partnership, essential for our shared long-term growth. Let\u2019s work towards a solution that benefits both parties."

This acknowledges GTI's established market presence while still recognizing EPS's innovative technology. This balanced approach can strengthen our partnership and drive collaborative innovation. What are your thoughts?"
