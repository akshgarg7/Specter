However, given EPS's advanced energy storage technologies and their market potential, we confidently advocate for a 55-45 split. This will not only reflect our shared value but also incentivize both parties to drive innovation post-merger. Let's explore this further."

However, to ensure GTI's commitment to leading the merger, we believe the 60-40 split is crucial for maintaining our strategic direction. Perhaps a performance-based incentive structure could align both parties' interests and reward innovation over time?"
