Equity split of 60% (BWE) and 40% (EPS) reflects our value accurately. We\u2019re committed to fostering a collaborative leadership and ensuring cultural integration for success."

However, given GTI's significant revenue contribution and market position, we believe a 60% (GTI) and 40% (EPS) equity split is justified. This reflects our investment in innovation and growth. Let's also discuss a clear cultural integration plan to ensure seamless collaboration."

        "message": "We appreciate your perspective on the equity split. However, EPS's advanced energy storage technology warrants a 55% (GTI) and 45% (EPS) split. This partnership should empower both companies\u2019 innovations. Regarding cultural integration, we propose joint committees for ongoing collaboration, ensuring alignment and smooth transitions as we merge our operations."

Joint committees for cultural integration are a great idea; they will help facilitate ongoing collaboration. Let's ensure we establish a clear framework to support this transition effectively."
