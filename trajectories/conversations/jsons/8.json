However, in the interest of fostering collaboration and mutual benefit, we are willing to consider a more balanced approach. \n\nWe suggest an equitable split of **60% for GTI and 40% for EPS**. This adjustment acknowledges EPS\u2019s valuable battery technology and market position while ensuring that GTI's substantial contributions are fairly recognized. In doing so, we believe we can create a more harmonious foundation for our combined future and promote a sense of ownership among both parties.\n\n### **Leadership Structure**\n\nRegarding the leadership structure, GTI firmly believes that the merger should be led by a single CEO from GTI, given our well-established market leadership and operational expertise. However, we appreciate EPS's desire for a co-CEO arrangement to ensure that both parties feel equally represented during the critical integration phase.\n\nTo address this concern, we propose a compromise where GTI's CEO will lead the merged entity, but we are open to appointing a **Chief Operating Officer (COO) from EPS**. Additionally, we could create a **Chief Technology Officer (CTO) position** that will oversee both the solar and battery technology divisions, ensuring that EPS's innovations are given proper attention and that both company cultures are represented in leadership.\n\nThis structure allows for clear, decisive leadership while also valuing the contributions and expertise of both companies. \n\n### **Next Steps**\n\nI encourage you to share your thoughts on this proposed equity split and leadership structure. Your feedback is invaluable as we work towards a solution that is beneficial for both GTI and EPS while aligning with our long-term goals of creating a market leader in integrated renewable energy solutions."

However, acknowledging the value that EPS brings with its advanced battery technology and market presence, we have adjusted our proposal to a 60% (GTI) and 40% (EPS) equity split.

EPS's contributions are vital, and we are committed to fostering a partnership where both sides feel valued and motivated.\n\n### **Leadership Structure**\n\nRegarding the leadership structure, GTI proposes that our CEO lead the merged entity, reflecting GTI's extensive experience and established market position. However, we recognize the importance of a seamless transition and the expertise that EPS brings to the table. \n\nTo create a collaborative environment, we suggest appointing a COO from EPS, who can provide insights into the integration of operations and maintain strong relationships with utility companies. Additionally, we propose establishing a new position for a Chief Technology Officer (CTO) that would be filled jointly. This role could ensure that the innovative strengths of both companies are leveraged effectively as we develop new products together.\n\nIn summary, our proposal aims to create a balanced leadership structure that honors the strengths of both organizations, while also ensuring strong guidance and direction from GTI. \n\n**Next Steps:** I would like to hear your thoughts on these proposed terms. Specifically, how do you feel about the revised equity split, and what concerns might you have regarding the leadership structure?"

This fairness is essential for fostering a positive working relationship post-merger. Perhaps we can reach a middle ground, possibly agreeing on a 60%-40% split as a starting point, while also discussing performance metrics or milestones that could allow EPS to gain more favorable terms in the future based on the success of our collaborative efforts.\n\n### Leadership Structure\n\nRegarding the leadership structure, GTI's preference for its CEO to lead the merged entity stems from our established experience in the renewable energy market.

The potential of our combined technologies can create a more resilient market position, especially as demand for integrated renewable energy solutions continues to grow.\n\nI propose that we consider a tiered equity structure that allows EPS to potentially increase its equity stake over time based on performance metrics.

This dual-leadership approach would not only help to integrate our distinct corporate cultures but also ensure that both companies feel equally represented in the direction of the merged entity. This is particularly important given the current dynamics of both organizations, as EPS operates with a more innovative and flexible approach.\n\nThe suggestion of having a COO from EPS is welcomed, and I would support that as part of a broader initiative to include key leadership from both sides in critical roles. Furthermore, the creation of a CTO position is an excellent idea. I propose that we also establish a joint executive committee to oversee the integration process, with equal representation from both GTI and EPS, to ensure that both companies' strengths are leveraged effectively.\n\nBy working collaboratively on the leadership structure, we can foster a culture of shared responsibility, innovation, and mutual respect, which will be vital for the success of our merged entity. \n\nI look forward to your thoughts on these suggestions, as I believe they can help us reach an agreement that supports both parties\u2019 interests and long-term goals."
