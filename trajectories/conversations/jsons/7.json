On leadership, while we respect EPS's desire for shared leadership, we believe a strong CEO from GTI will ensure focused integration and effective decision-making. How does EPS envision addressing these areas?"

        "message": "We appreciate GTI\u2019s position on the equity split. However, given EPS's advanced energy storage technology and its strategic value, a 60% (GTI) to 40% (EPS) split is more equitable. For leadership, we propose a co-CEO arrangement for the first two years to leverage both strengths effectively during integration. This approach can enhance collaboration and ensure smooth transitions. How does that align with GTI\u2019s vision?"

        "speaker": "Harvey (GTI)",
        "message": "While we recognize the value of EPS's technology, GTI's market presence and resources warrant a 60% equity stake. Regarding leadership, our preference for a sole CEO is based on the need for clear direction. However, we\u2019re open to discussing a COO role from EPS to ensure collaborative integration. Would that be acceptable?"
