We advocate for a 55%-45% equity split and a co-CEO arrangement for seamless integration. We aim to protect our IP and ensure minimal employee disruption. Let's explore these points collaboratively."

        "message": "I appreciate your perspective and recognize the importance of your strategic objectives. However, GTI's 65%-35% equity proposal reflects our significant contributions and market positioning. Regarding leadership, a single CEO from GTI ensures clear direction for the merged entity. Let's discuss how we can structure IP protections and employee transition plans that satisfy both parties."

        "speaker": "Mike (EPS)",
        "message": "I understand GTI's position, but EPS's advanced energy storage technology warrants a more equitable 55%-45% split. A co-CEO model will foster collaboration during integration, ensuring both companies' strengths are maximized. For IP, we propose joint ownership with protections in place. Let's work together on an employee transition plan that minimizes layoffs while addressing overlaps."

    {
        "speaker": "Harvey (GTI)",
        "message": "Your points are noted, but GTI must prioritize its strategic interests. We propose a compromise at a 60%-40% equity split, recognizing both contributions while maintaining our lead. A single CEO will streamline decision-making, ensuring effective integration. Joint ownership of IP is acceptable, provided GTI has access for development. We can certainly collaborate on a thoughtful employee transition plan that minimizes disruption while addressing overlaps."
