We advocate for a balanced equity split, a co-CEO arrangement, and robust IP protections to foster innovation and growth for both parties. Your thoughts?"

        "speaker": "Harvey (GTI)",
        "message": "We appreciate your emphasis on balance and collaboration. However, GTI's 65%-35% equity split reflects our significant contributions and market position. A CEO from GTI is crucial for leadership continuity, while we can address IP protections through shared commitments. Let's ensure we align our long-term goals effectively."

        "speaker": "Mike (EPS)",
        "message": "I understand GTI's position. However, EPS\u2019s advanced energy storage technology warrants a more equitable split, ideally 60%-40%. A co-CEO arrangement will ensure both companies\u2019 strengths are leveraged during integration. This approach will foster innovation and promote a collaborative leadership style. How do you see this aligning with GTI's interests?"
    },
    {
        "speaker": "Harvey (GTI)",
        "message": "Your proposal for a 60%-40% split is a step toward compromise, but GTI's contributions and market leadership justify our preference for 65%-35%. Regarding leadership, we can explore a COO role for EPS to leverage their strengths without compromising our CEO's position. This ensures effective integration while maintaining clear direction."
