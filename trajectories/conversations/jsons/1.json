This would not only recognize our contributions but also foster a collaborative spirit for future innovation. Let\u2019s explore potential performance-based adjustments to align our interests effectively."

Performance-based adjustments could be a viable solution, but let\u2019s ensure they are realistic and reflect GTI\u2019s significant market presence. How does that sound?"
