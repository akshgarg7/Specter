To achieve this, we propose a 60-40 equity split recognizing GTI's market position and EPS's technological contributions. Let's discuss how we can address your concerns regarding leadership and cultural integration effectively."

Regarding leadership, a co-CEO arrangement initially can ensure integration success and leverage both companies' strengths. Let's explore this compromise further, along with cultural alignment strategies that respect both company cultures."

We can agree to consider your co-CEO suggestion for a limited timeframe while ensuring GTI's leadership remains prominent. As for cultural alignment, we are open to joint committees to facilitate integration. Let's discuss specific strategies that honor both cultures."
