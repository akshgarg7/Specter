We aim for a fair equity split, strong leadership structure, and robust IP protections to ensure long-term success for the merged entity.

For leadership, a co-CEO arrangement for the first two years can foster collaboration. Regarding IP, we agree on shared access with protections for both parties. Let's find common ground."

        "message": "I appreciate your proposals and recognize the importance of collaboration. However, GTI's contribution justifies a 65-35 split to reflect our substantial market presence. We can consider a transitional leadership role for EPS but must prioritize GTI's CEO. For IP, access with protections is acceptable, provided GTI retains primary control. Let\u2019s refine these terms for mutual benefit."
