        "message": "Thank you for bringing this up. The equity split and leadership structure are pivotal components of the merger, and it's important that we address these thoughtfully to ensure a successful collaboration between GTI and EPS.\n\n### **Equity Split**\n\nGTI initially proposed a 65% to 35% equity split based on our revenue and profit contributions. However, recognizing the importance of finding common ground, we have revised our stance and suggest a more balanced approach of 60% for GTI and 40% for EPS. This proposal reflects a fair acknowledgment of EPS's valuable battery technology while ensuring that GTI retains a majority share, which is essential for maintaining our strategic direction and long-term goals.\n\nWe believe this equitable distribution will foster a sense of partnership and shared responsibility, aligning both companies toward achieving our ambitious growth targets in the integrated renewable energy market. \n\n### **Leadership Structure**\n\nRegarding the leadership structure, GTI strongly believes that having our CEO lead the merged entity is crucial. Given GTI's established market presence and experience, this leadership position would provide the necessary vision and strategic oversight to navigate the complexities of the merger and drive the combined company forward.\n\nHowever, I'm open to discussing your proposal for a co-CEO arrangement for the first two years. Perhaps we could consider appointing our CEO as the CEO and your COO as the President or an equally significant executive role during this transitional period. This would ensure representation from both sides while allowing for a clear leadership hierarchy, which can be particularly beneficial in the early stages of integration.\n\n### **Next Steps**\n\nI encourage you to share your thoughts on this proposal. It\u2019s essential that we listen actively to your priorities, as I believe finding a mutually beneficial solution will set a positive tone for our ongoing discussions. Together, we can ensure that the merger not only aligns with our respective interests but also positions us competitively in the marketplace."

        "message": "Thank you for bringing up these crucial points\u2014equity split and leadership structure are foundational to a successful merger. \n\n### **Equity Split**\n\nGTI initially proposed a 65% equity stake for GTI and 35% for EPS, based on our substantial market share, revenue contributions, and strong financial performance. However, we understand that EPS has expressed a desire for a more balanced split, suggesting a 55% (GTI) and 45% (EPS) distribution. \n\nTo reach a mutually beneficial agreement, we propose a compromise of a **60% (GTI) and 40% (EPS)** equity split. This acknowledges the value that both parties bring to the table\u2014GTI\u2019s established market presence and EPS's innovative battery technology\u2014while ensuring GTI retains a controlling interest that reflects our contributions to the merged entity\u2019s future direction and strategy.\n\n### **Leadership Structure**\n\nLeadership is another area where we see potential for alignment. GTI proposes having its CEO lead the merged organization, given our proven track record and experience in the solar market. This is essential for setting a clear strategic vision and maintaining investor confidence.\n\nHowever, we also recognize EPS\u2019s proposal for a co-CEO arrangement during the initial integration phase. This could help facilitate smoother transitions and address any apprehensions from EPS stakeholders. \n\nTo find a middle ground, we suggest the following leadership structure:\n- **CEO from GTI**: This ensures a strong leadership presence aligned with GTI\u2019s strategic objectives.\n- **COO from EPS**: This role would focus on integrating EPS\u2019s advanced technology and operational processes into the new organization, leveraging their expertise in battery storage systems.\n- **CTO**: A newly created position to be filled jointly, reflecting the innovative strengths of both companies and fostering collaboration in R&D.\n\nThis structure balances both companies' interests and expertise while fostering a collaborative leadership environment. \n\nI look forward to your thoughts on these proposals and to working together to finalize terms that respect the priorities of both parties."

        "message": "Absolutely, these are critical components of the merger negotiation, and I appreciate your willingness to engage in this discussion.\n\n### **Equity Split:**\nGTI is proposing a 60% (GTI) and 40% (EPS) equity split in recognition of our respective contributions in revenue and profit. Given GTI's established market presence, strong financial performance, and significant R&D capabilities, we believe this split accurately reflects the value each company brings to the table.\n\nHowever, I understand that EPS sees the value of their advanced battery technology as a strong justification for a higher equity stake. I\u2019d like to explore how we can find common ground here. For instance, if we can agree to the 60/40 split but include performance milestones that allow EPS to earn additional equity based on achieving certain integration and revenue targets post-merger, this could align our interests while still honoring GTI\u2019s contributions.\n\n### **Leadership Structure:**\nRegarding the leadership structure, GTI\u2019s preference is to have our CEO lead the merged entity, which would provide consistency and leverage our established market strategy. \n\nThat being said, I recognize EPS\u2019s proposal for a co-CEO arrangement for the first two years. This could potentially offer a smoother integration process, allowing both companies to maintain a sense of leadership balance. However, I would propose that we consider a slightly modified approach with a clear delineation of responsibilities to prevent any overlap in decision-making. For instance, GTI could lead overall corporate strategy while EPS could focus on operational execution during the integration phase.\n\nI\u2019m committed to ensuring that both parties feel valued and represented in this new entity. I\u2019d like to hear your thoughts on these proposals and any specific concerns you might have. Let's work together to create a structure that supports both our long-term goals."

        "message": "Thank you for bringing up these critical topics for discussion. \n\n**Equity Split:**\nGTI's initial proposal for a 65% (GTI) and 35% (EPS) equity split was grounded in our respective financial contributions and market positions. Given that GTI holds approximately 15% of the U.S. solar panel market with substantial revenue and net profit, we believe this reflects our substantial investment and market presence.\n\nHowever, in the spirit of collaboration and recognizing the value that EPS brings through its advanced battery technology, we have considered your perspective and are open to a compromise. We propose a revised equity split of 60% (GTI) and 40% (EPS). This adjustment acknowledges EPS's contributions while still aligning with GTI's long-term interests and financial stability.\n\n**Leadership Structure:**\nOn the leadership front, GTI advocates for its CEO to lead the merged entity, reflecting the experience and stability that our leadership has demonstrated in navigating the solar industry. At the same time, we recognize the importance of ensuring a smooth integration and the value of EPS's input.\n\nTo that end, we believe a balanced approach would be beneficial: we propose that GTI's CEO assume the role of the merged entity's CEO, while we appoint a COO from EPS. This arrangement would leverage GTI's market experience while ensuring that EPS's strategic insights are integrated into the leadership structure. Additionally, we suggest the creation of a CTO role that can be filled jointly to drive innovation in both solar and storage technologies.\n\nIn summary, our proposed terms for the equity split and leadership structure aim to create a foundation for a successful partnership, while also aligning with GTI\u2019s core interests and long-term goals. I\u2019d like to hear your thoughts on this proposal and any specific concerns or priorities you may have regarding these elements."
